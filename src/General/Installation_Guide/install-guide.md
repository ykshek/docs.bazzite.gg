## Preliminary Setup

### **Important Installation Notes**:

- Use a download manager (like [**Motrix**](https://motrix.app/)) if the direct download fails or is downloading too slow.

- A physical wired keyboard is **recommended** and **required for devices without a touchscreen**.

- Create a User Account with a **username** and a **user password** if you have a keyboard.

- Make sure to only select the appropriate drives to avoid losing data on others, and it is best practice to safely remove any external drives before proceeding.

- Secure Boot is supported on most hardware, but you must [**enroll our key**](./secure_boot.md).

### System Requirements

Read the [**Hardware Compatibility Guide**](<link doc>) for Bazzite's system requirements.

If you are dual-booting with Windows then read the [dualbooting guide](<link guide>).  Automatic partitioning is the only option available in the live ISO, but it should work for most people's dual-booting usecases.  If you require manual partitioning, then use the legacy ISO and follow the [manual partitioning guide](<link this>).
