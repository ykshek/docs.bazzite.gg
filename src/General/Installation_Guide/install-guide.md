## Video Walkthrough

<link Wolfyreload's video>

## System Requirements

- Read the [**Hardware Compatibility Guide**](./Gaming/Hardware_compatibility_for_gaming.md) for Bazzite's system requirements.
- **Secure Boot and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) are supported on most hardware**, but you must **enroll our key during or after installation**.

### Installer Requirements

- A way to download the Bazzite ISO
  - A download manager (like [**Motrix**](https://motrix.app/)) if the direct download for the Bazzite ISO fails or is downloading too slow.
- A 16GB+ bootable medium like a Flash Drive
  - Software to flash the ISO like **Fedora Media Writer** ([**Windows/macOS**](https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter/releases) or [**Linux**](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.fedoraproject.MediaWriter))
- A physical wired keyboard is **recommended** and **required for devices without a touchscreen**.
  - Otherwise, create a User Account with a **username** and a **user password** if you have a keyboard.

### Desktop Environments

All of the images come with the choice of [**KDE Plasma**](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) or
[**GNOME**](https://www.gnome.org/) for their desktop environment.

[**Steam Gaming Mode**](https://github.com/KyleGospo/gamescope-session) is an option as an additional session to run on top of KDE Plasma or GNOME but is only recommended for Home Theatre PC (HTPC) and handheld setups.

More information can be found on our [**FAQ**](https://faq.bazzite.gg) about the differences between the image variants.

### Booting The Installer

#### GRUB Menu

![boot|1573x872, 50%](../../img/live-installer-grub.png)

#### Live Installer

![live|1431x897, 60%](../../img/live-installer-opening.png)



#### Network 

![network|495x593, 100%](../../img/live-installer-network.png)

Please note that an internet is not required to install Bazzite, but is useful if you're testing Bazzite before testing in the live environment.

#### Select Language, Region, and Keyboard Layout

![installer1|1295x1054, 62%](../../img/live-installer-time-date.png)

#### Partitioning Options

!!! warning

    Make sure to only select the appropriate drives to avoid losing data on others, and it is best practice to safely remove any external drives before proceeding.

##### Dual Booting

!!! note

     The "format as efi" button when dual-booting says it will format the Windows EFI, but what it actually does is add itself to the EFI. This is an upstream bug with the installer.

If you are dual-booting with Windows then read the [dualbooting guide](<link guide>).  Automatic partitioning is the only option available in the live ISO, but it should work for most people's dual-booting usecases.  If you require manual partitioning, then use the legacy ISO and follow the [manual partitioning guide](<link this>).

^^^this should be a comment but maybe just have dualboot guide here and have the other one be the legacy one? idk.... ahhhhhhh... maybe secure boot guide should part of this too?

##### Disk Encryption

#### User Account Setup

![installer2|1288x1050, 62%](../../img/live-installer-user-setup.png)

!!! warning

    It is not recommended to enable a root account.
