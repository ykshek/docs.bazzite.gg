## System Requirements

- Read the [**Hardware Compatibility Guide**](<link doc>) for Bazzite's system requirements.
- Secure Boot and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) are supported on most hardware, but you must [**enroll our key during or after installation**](./secure_boot.md).

### Installer Requirements

- A way to download the Bazzite ISO
  - A download manager (like [**Motrix**](https://motrix.app/)) if the direct download for the Bazzite ISO fails or is downloading too slow.
- A 16GB+ bootable medium like a Flash Drive
  - Software to flash the ISO like **Fedora Media Writer** ([**Windows/macOS**](https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter/releases) or [**Linux**](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.fedoraproject.MediaWriter))
- A physical wired keyboard is **recommended** and **required for devices without a touchscreen**.
  - Otherwise, create a User Account with a **username** and a **user password** if you have a keyboard.

### Desktop Environments

All of the images come with the choice of [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) or
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) for their desktop environment.

[Steam Gaming Mode](https://github.com/KyleGospo/gamescope-session) is an option and is recommended for HTPC setups.

More information can be found on our [FAQ](https://faq.bazzite.gg) about the differences between the image variants.

Please note that an internet is not required to install Bazzite, but is useful if you're testing Bazzite before testing in the live environment.

#### Select Language, Region, and Keyboard Layout

#### Partitioning Options

!!! warning

    Make sure to only select the appropriate drives to avoid losing data on others, and it is best practice to safely remove any external drives before proceeding.

If you are dual-booting with Windows then read the [dualbooting guide](<link guide>).  Automatic partitioning is the only option available in the live ISO, but it should work for most people's dual-booting usecases.  If you require manual partitioning, then use the legacy ISO and follow the [manual partitioning guide](<link this>).

#### User Account Setup
