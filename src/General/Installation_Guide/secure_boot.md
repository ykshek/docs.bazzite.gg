# Secure Boot Guide

## Bazzite Supports Secure Boot

!!! note

    Click "Coninue boot" if your device doesn't support Secure Boot or you don't want to enable it.

!!! important

    The enrollment prompt uses an English QWERTY keyboard layout, indiscriminately of your actual hardware keyboard. Other layouts can therefore interfere with the characters of the password (i.e. `A` and `Q` are swapped on AZERTY layouts).

Bazzite supports Secure Boot however Universal Blue's key must be enrolled to use it otherwise keeping Secure Boot on in your BIOS will result in Bazzite not booting.

## Important Secure Boot Notes:

- Entering the password will register invisible characters for security purposes, so you will not be able to see what you are typing!
- Updating your BIOS may re-enable Secure Boot and you may have to follow **"Method B"** after updating it to resolve the black screen on boot complaining about loading the kernel first.
- The Steam Deck does **not** come with secure boot enabled and does not ship with any keys enrolled by default, do not enable Secure Boot on your Steam Deck unless you absolutely know what you're doing.

## Error Message (if key is **not** enrolled properly):

```
error: ../../grub-core/kern/efi/sb.c:182:bad shim signature.
error: ../../grub-core/loader/1389/efi/linux.c:256:you need to load the kernel first.

Press any key to continue...
```

Follow **Method B** below to resolve this and move past the error message if you encounter it.

### **Method A** - During Installation Method

![Secure Boot menu: Continue boot / Enroll MOK / Enroll key from disk / Enroll hash from disk|690x378, 50%](../../img/Secure_Boot.jpeg 'Secure Boot')

!!! note

    This screen will also appear on the next boot if you enable Secure Boot if it was disabled during installation.

A blue screen will appear giving the option to enroll the signed keys after leaving the Bazzite installer.

`Enroll MOK` if you have secure boot enabled. If prompted to enter a password, then **enter**:

```command
universalblue
```

Otherwise `Continue boot` if you have Secure Boot disabled or if it is not supported with your hardware.

## **Method B** - After Installation Method

**Disable Secure Boot in the BIOS before proceeding**, and then re-enable it **after enrolling the key**.

If you have already installed Bazzite then **enter this command in a host terminal**:

```
ujust enroll-secure-boot-key
```

If prompted to enroll the required key, then **enter the password in the host terminal**:

```command
universalblue
```

**You can now turn Secure Boot back on in the BIOS.**
Use the following command to boot straight into your system's BIOS (if supported):

```command
ujust bios
```
## Complete MOK enrollment at boot

On the next boot, you will see the blue MokManager screen:

1.  Choose **Enroll MOK**.
2.  When prompted for a password, enter:
    ```command
    universalblue
    ```

After the reboot, the key is enrolled and Secure Boot can remain enabled. Your system should now boot normally under Secure Boot.
