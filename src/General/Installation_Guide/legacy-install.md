# Legacy Installation Guide

## For Legacy ISOs Only

This guide is only for the legacy ISOs which are still supported at this time.

## System Requirements

- Read the [**Hardware Compatibility Guide**](<link doc>) for Bazzite's system requirements.
- Secure Boot and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) are supported on most hardware, but you must [**enroll our key during or after installation**](./secure_boot.md).

### Installer Requirements

- A way to download the Bazzite ISO
  - A download manager (like [**Motrix**](https://motrix.app/)) if the direct download for the Bazzite ISO fails or is downloading too slow.
- A 16GB+ bootable medium like a Flash Drive
  - Software to flash the ISO like **Fedora Media Writer** ([**Windows/macOS**](https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter/releases) or [**Linux**](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.fedoraproject.MediaWriter))
- A physical wired keyboard is **recommended** and **required for devices without a touchscreen**.
  - Otherwise, create a User Account with a **username** and a **user password** if you have a keyboard.

## Desktop Environments

All of the images come with the choice of [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) or
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) for their desktop environment.

[Steam Gaming Mode](https://github.com/KyleGospo/gamescope-session) is an option and is recommended for HTPC setups.

More information can be found on our [FAQ](https://faq.bazzite.gg) about the differences between the image variants.

### 2. Boot Bazzite

- Connect your bootable medium to your device and boot into it.
- After connecting the device, boot into the Bazzite installer.
- This depends on your motherboard hardware, but most of the time it could be a function keys like <kbd>F9</kbd> or similar.
  - Sometimes you need to consult the manual, look up your device online, or read any hotkeys that appear when you boot your PC.
    - Alternatively change the BIOS settings to boot with your bootable device first before your current storage, but this is **not recommended** to keep enabled after installing Bazzite.
- Verify the media correctly and proceed to the installer.

#### Handheld Users

Hold the 'Volume Down' (<kbd>-</kbd>) button and click the Power Button, and when you hear the chime, let go of both buttons, and you'll be booted into the Boot Manager. When you get to the boot menu, select your bootable device to boot into the Bazzite installer.

### 3. Inside the Installation Medium

!!! note "Installing Bazzite without a physical keyboard connected to your device:"

    If you do not have a usb physical keyboard connected, do **NOT** press "_User Creation_", since it will remove the default username and password, and you will be unable to type a username or password without a physical keyboard.

    **default user**: `bazzite`
    **default password**: `bazzite`

![Automatic drive configuration|690x497, 75%](../../img/anaconda_drive_configuration.png)

![User setup example|690x359, 75%](../../img/anaconda_user_setup.png)

- Select your language, region, keyboard layout, and time zone.
- Select the drive that Bazzite is going to be installed on.
  - Delete any partitions that you have remaining on the drive **unless dual booting on the same drive**.
  - Recommended to use the automatic storage configuration **unless dual booting on the same drive**.
- Optionally encrypt the drive with a password if desired.
  - **If you lose this password, then it cannot be decrypted**.
  - A PHYSICAL WIRED KEYBOARD IS REQUIRED TO UNLOCK THE DEVICE!
- Setup a user account.
  - Give administrative privileges and **set a user password**.
- Begin the installation.
- Reboot device after it has finished installing.

## Dual Booting

1. Installing Bazzite with a shared drive.
2. Installing Bazzite on a separate drive.

=== "Shared Drive (Automatic Partitioning)"

    1. (In Windows) Disable **Bitlocker encryption** and **fastboot**, and reboot.
    2. (In Windows) Resize the Windows partition with the Disk Management app to have enough space for Bazzite.
    Usually should look something like this:
    ![](/img/dualbooting_partitions_windows.png)]
    <i><small>Source: [diskpart.com](https://www.diskpart.com/windows-10/windows-10-disk-management-0528.html)</small></i>
    3. Run the Bazzite installer with the automatic partitioning option.
    4. Reboot into Bazzite and run `ujust regenerate-grub` in the terminal to add Windows to the GRUB.


=== "Shared Drive (Manual Partitioning) [Only Available on Legacy ISO]"

    1. (In Windows) Resize the Windows partition with the Disk Management app to have enough space for Bazzite.
    Usually should look something like this:
    ![](/img/dualbooting_partitions_windows.png)
    <i><small>Source: [diskpart.com](https://www.diskpart.com/windows-10/windows-10-disk-management-0528.html)</small></i>
    2. Run the Bazzite installer with [manual partitioning](./manual_partitioning.md)
    3. Reboot into Bazzite and run `ujust regenerate-grub` in the terminal to add Windows to the GRUB.

=== "Separate Drive"

    **When a dedicated drive is feasible, this method is recommended.**

    Install Bazzite on a separate internal or external drive.

    1. Install the other operating system on a drive (like Windows).
    2. Install Bazzite on a **second** drive.
    3. Set Bazzite as the **default** in your boot order (optional).

    If you install Windows second, you should disconnect the Bazzite drive to prevent using the Windows installer of using its EFI partition.

    You can also install Windows to an external drive with Windows-to-Go using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) to dual boot if you do not have an internal drive available.

If you install Windows after Bazzite, you can restore Bazzite's bootloader with the **Bootloader Restoring Tool** in the Live ISO.

### Manual Partitioning Instructions

!!! warning "Only users who are dual booting on the same drive should use these instructions. Automatic partitioning is preferred in other cases."

!!! warning "Bazzite only supports the BTRFS filesystem for `/`."

If you need a tutorial video for manual partitioning, watch this [tutorial at timestamp 9:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPsKhJGTrs&t=550s).

1.  Select Installation Destination
2.  Select `Advanced Custom(Blivet-GUI)` under Storage Configuration.
![Selecting manual partitioning](../../img/select_manual_partitioning.png)
3.  Create the following partitions and devices:
  - **/boot/efi**
    ![EFI partition](../../img/efi_partition.png)
    ```
    mount point: /boot/efi
    format:      EFI system partition
    size:        300MB
    ```
  - **/boot**
    ![boot partition](../../img/boot_partition.png)
    ```
    mount point: /boot
    format:      ext4
    size:        2GB
    ```
  - **btrfs partition**
    ![btrfs partition](../../img/btrfs_partition.png)
    ```
    mount point:
    format: btrfs
    size: [max]
    ```
  - **/**
    ![/ subvolume](../../img/root_subvolume.png)
    ```
    mount point: /
    format:      btrfs (subvolume)
    ```
  - **/var**
    ![/var subvolume](../../img/var_subvolume.png)
    ```
    mount point: /var
    format:      btrfs (subvolume)
    ```
  - **/var/home**
    ![/var/home subvolume](../../img/var_home_subvolume.png)
    ```
    mount point: /var/home
    format:      btrfs (subvolume)
    ```
4.  Select Done
5.  Select Accept Changes
6.  Continue with the installation.

#### Note about dual booting other distributions

For Fedora Atomic Desktop images on the **same** drive:

- To dual boot another **Fedora Atomic Desktop image** (like [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/)) installed alongside Bazzite, you must make an additional EFI partition and switch between them through your motherboard's UEFI boot menu.

For dual booting on **separate** drives:

- Use your motherboard's UEFI boot menu as the GRUB bootloader may not recognize each boot entry correctly.

!!! note 

    Dual booting with **other distributions**, especially **non-atomic Fedora**, is not officially supported. It is recommended to use your motherboard's UEFI boot menu or to forgo dual booting entirely to avoid unexpected issues. If something does go wrong, restore Bazzite's bootloader using the **Bootloader Restoring Tool** in the Live ISO.

#### Dual Boot Post-Configuration Setup

Show both your Windows and Bazzite installations in the GRUB menu to select from at boot by entering this **command into the terminal**:

```
ujust regenerate-grub
```

#### Bazzite as Primary Boot

If the `OS Boot Manager` has set `Windows Boot Manager` to be the first boot priority, then this may result in booting directly into Windows after the install instead of Bazzite. You may have to fix this in your BIOS settings.

Take note that the GRUB menu might not show up. In such case, spam the <kbd>↓</kbd> key when booting up.

#### Boot into Windows from Steam

Adds a script in Steam to boot into Windows.

```
ujust setup-boot-windows-steam
```

#### Expanding storage size in a Windows dual-boot scenario

!!! note

    This is for future reference after dual-booting for a while.

**Watch this video tutorial on how to expand the storage**:

## Post-Installation

![Rollbacks|690x402, 50%](../../img/GRUB_Menu.png)

The first boot will show a screen showing your current and last deployment. It is important to note that the GRUB menu can be used to rollback Bazzite deployments if you encounter issues.

Read more about this in the [Updates, Rollback, and Rebasing documentation](../../Installing_and_Managing_Software/Updates_Rollbacks_and_Rebasing/index.md).

### Setting Up Steam Gaming Mode (Bazzite-Deck Only)

![Gaming Mode Setup|690x442, 50%](../../img/pLvHB1NAMlb3ghsR72q7l9Auj8B.jpeg)

After completing all of the above, then your next boot will be in Steam Gaming Mode which requires additional setup for Steam.

### Configuring System Settings for KDE Plasma and GNOME

![Display Settings (KDE Plasma)|690x370, 75%](../../img/KDE_Display_Settings.png)
**_KDE Plasma's System Settings application_**

![Display Settings (GNOME)|690x344, 75%](../../img/GNOME_Display_Settings.png)
**_GNOME's Settings application_**

It is important to configure the system settings on a first boot to personalize your desktop especially if you notice the scaling is incorrect on first-boot.

### Secondary Storage Filesystems

!!! note

    Bazzite will automatically mount secondary drives that are formatted as Ext4 or BTRFS by default.

**BTRFS is the default and recommended filesystem for Bazzite**.  Any secondary drives that you plan to play video games on should be **backed up and reformatted to either Ext4 or BTRFS, however the drive will lose all of the data when performing this operation**.  You can use [**GNOME Disks to format the drives appropriately at your own risk**](../Advanced/Auto-Mounting_Secondary_Drives.md).

#### Unsupported Filesystems for Secondary Drives

!!! CRITICAL

    NTFS and exFAT/FAT32 ARE NOT SUPPORTED. BOTH FILESYSTEMS CAN AND WILL LEAD TO DATA CORRUPTION UNDER LINUX. DO NOT USE THEM!
    winBTRFS UNDER WINDOWS STILL HAS BUGS AND IS ALSO NOT A SOLUTION. 
    
    THERE IS CURRENTLY NO RELIABLE CROSS-PLATFORM FILESYSTEM THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH WINDOWS AND LINUX.


!!! warning

    You will lose all of your data reformatting secondary internal/external drives.

##### NTFS

If you are coming from Windows and plan to game on a secondary drive with games already installed on it, then we regret to inform you that the NTFS filesystem is **unsupported** for PC gaming on Bazzite.  Playing games off of a NTFS formatted drive can cause various issues, including but not limited to **games not launching at all**, and will eventually result in **data corruption** and **permanent data loss**!

##### exFAT and FAT32

FAT32 and exFAT are **unsupported**. Both filesystems **do not support symbolic links** which is required for Proton prefixes to work properly.  However, there are scenarios where a microSD card is formatted to exFAT _may work_ in some cases, but this method is unsupported as something the Bazzite maintainers do not plan to accommodate.

#### Sharing Games with a Windows Dual-Boot

Install the unofficial [WinBtrfs](https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs) driver on your Windows installation **at your own risk**. Please make sure to read any documentation associated with this project before installing the driver on Windows.

### Changing Default Password
<sub> (If it wasn't changed in the installer) </sub>

![KDE Plasma's Change Password|584x500, 75%](../../img/change-pass.png)

Change it in the settings of Desktop Mode under the "User" category.
