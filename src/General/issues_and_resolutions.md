# Common Issues & Resolution

## Steam Big Picture Mode is slow

**Issue:** When you select **Steam Menu >> View >> Big Picture** the user interface may run sluggish. However, the games that run through the interface are working smoothly.

**Resolution:** Close Steam completely and start Steam using the **Steam Big Picture Mode** menu shortcut. Also make sure that **Steam Settings >> Interface >> Enable GPU accelerated rendering in web views (requires restart)** is enabled in the Steam settings.

>**Note**: This fix also fixes the performance issues in Steam Gamming Mode on Nvidia GPUs, however, this comes with a drawback that the Steam menu and side menu sometimes do not render properly.

## Audio is soft on ASUS ROG Ally hardware

**Issue:** The sound is quiet even if at maximum volume.

**Resolution:** There are two audio devices that appear on the Rog Ally:
- **Family 17h/19h/1ah HD Audio Controller**
- **ROG Ally**

Both affect each other's audio volume so they must be at the same volume level.

## Gamepads and handheld joysticks don't work in Desktop Mode

**Issue:** Gamepads and handheld device joysticks don't work in desktop mode, so you have to use the touchscreen or connect an external mouse.

Open up **Steam Settings >> Controller >> Non-Game Controller Layouts >> Desktop Layout**. Click on **Edit** Then **Enable Steam Input** and configure how the controller needs to as a keyboard and mouse in Desktop Mode.

!!! Tip "You'll often need to reduce the **Right Joystick Sensitivity** to somewhere between 50-80%. Otherwise, the mouse cursor will be too fast and will not be reliable."

## Setting Bazzite's Desktop Editions to automatically login

**Issue:** How do you configure automatic login in Bazzite?

<h3>KDE Plasma Resolution</h3>

Open **System Settings >> Colors and Themes >> Login Screen (SDDM)** then on the right side of the screen there will be a button labelled **Behaviour**, click on it.

Now tick **"Automatically log in"**, select your user and for the session, select **"Plasma (Wayland)"** and don't forget to to click on the **"Apply"** button.

<h3>GNOME Resolution</h3>

Open the **Settings application >> Users**. Click the **Unlock** button in the top right corner. Then switch on **Automatic Login**.

## HTPC legacy hardware setup

**Issue:** How do you setup a similar version to Bazzite-Deck using GPU hardware that is considered "legacy" and unsupported for Steam Gaming Mode?

**Resolution:** Enable auto-login and set Steam to automatically launch in Steam's Big Picture Mode for a decent couch gaming experience if you have legacy hardware.

There is a video guide that you can follow for Bazzite's GNOME Desktop image using a Nvidia GPU (before Nvidia hardware could run Steam Gaming Mode, but same idea):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9l-RQvCPMo

If you are using Bazzite's KDE Plasma image, then you can skip the "Making Gnome look more familiar to Windows users" section, and use the steps above to get auto login working in Bazzite KDE. Then finally set Steam Big Picture Mode to auto-start in **Settings >> Autostart**.

## No Wi-Fi or wired connection in Bazzite when dual-booting with Windows

**Issue:** You are dual-booting Windows with Bazzite and your Wi-Fi/wired connection works in Windows but fails in Bazzite sometimes.

**Resolution:** Fast Startup is a feature of Windows that puts your computer into a hybrid state between shutdown and hibernation to speed up the time it takes for Windows to start up. However, this setting can lock up hardware devices such as your Wi-Fi, ethernet and perhaps other hardware.  One solution is to select the Restart option instead of the Shutdown option, which will perform a full power cycle. However, a better solution is to simply disable Fast Startup.

You can do this by:

- Open **Control Panel**
- Click on **Hardware and Sound**
- Click on **Change what the power buttons do** which is under Power Options
- Click on **Change settings that are currently unavailable**
- Untick **Turn on fast startup (recommended)**
- (Optional) Untick **Hibernate** too if you don't use it as it can cause the same issues as Fast Startup
- Click on **Save changes**

Now if you now select the Shutdown option, Windows will shut down completely and not interfere with Bazzite.

## Wi-Fi is slow / Wi-Fi lag spikes

**Issue:** Your Wi-Fi performance is much slower than expected or has lag spikes, which interferes with voice chat and online games. The problem is not present in Windows.

**Resolution:** The Wi-Fi power saving feature in Linux seems to work poorly on some Wi-Fi devices under Linux.  Open the terminal and run `ip link show` this will list all your network devices and the output should look something like this:

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: wlp6s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00
```

The device that we are interested in is the Wi-Fi device. In this example (my ROG Ally), the Wi-Fi network is called `wlp6s0`.
Another common name for the Wi-Fi network is `wlan0`.

Next run `iw wlp6s0 get power_save` (change `wlp6s0` if your device name is different) to confirm if power saving is on:
```
Power save: on
```

There are different steps to resolve this depending on if you've disabled **iwd**. If you have updated or installed Bazzite after [1st Jan 2026](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-spring-cleaning-in-december-update/), **iwd** will be set as the default WiFi backend.
!!! info "For performance reasons, and to fix certain issues in relation to streaming, [`iwd`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd) replaced [`wpa_supplicant`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wpa_supplicant) as the default WiFi backend for Bazzite since 2026. To switch back, run `ujust toggle-iwd`. Note that switching will **remove** all network configurations."

=== "iwd (iwd is ON)"

    We are going to configure iwd to not use the power save feature for all Wi-Fi devices. Open a terminal and run

    ```bash
    printf "[DriverQuirks]\nPowerSaveDisable = *" | sudo tee /etc/iwd/main.conf
    systemctl restart iwd
    ```

    Next, run `iw wlp6s0 get power_save` to confirm that power save is off:
    ```
    Power save: off
    ```

    Note that this fix may negatively affect the battery life of your laptop or handheld. If you do wish to reverse this change, just delete the config file:
    ```bash
    sudo rm /etc/iwd/main.conf
    systemctl restart iwd
    ```

=== "wpa_supplicant (iwd is OFF)"

    We are going to configure NetworkManager to not use the power save feature for all Wi-Fi devices. Open a terminal and run

    ```bash
    printf "[connection]\nwifi.powersave = 2" | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf
    systemctl restart NetworkManager
    ```

    Next, run `iw wlp6s0 get power_save` to confirm that power save is off:
    ```
    Power save: off
    ```

    Note that this fix may negatively affect the battery life of your laptop or handheld. If you do wish to reverse this change, just delete the config file:
    ```bash
    sudo rm /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf
    systemctl restart NetworkManager
    ```

## Error on connecting to Wi-Fi: "Failed to add new connection: 802.1x connections must have IWD provisioning files"

!!! info "For performance reasons, and to fix certain issues in relation to streaming, [`iwd`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd) replaced [`wpa_supplicant`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wpa_supplicant) as the default WiFi backend for Bazzite since 2026. To switch back, run `ujust toggle-iwd`. Note that switching will **remove** all network configurations."

NetworkManager cannot automatically generate 802.1x connections when using the `iwd` backend.

If you prefer to keep using the `iwd` backend and just want to connect to `eduroam`, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo nano /var/lib/iwd/eduroam.8021x
```

Then add the following:

```bash
[Security]
EAP-Method=PEAP
EAP-Identity=anonymous@<university.domain>
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Method=MSCHAPV2
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Identity=<username@university.domain>
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Password=<password>

[Settings]
AutoConnect=true
```

Make sure to replace `<university.domain>`, `<username@university.domain>` and `<password>` with proper login information. Afterwards, press `Ctrl+X` and `Y` to Save & Exit.

Now try to connect again. If you still can't connect, execute:

```bash
nmcli connection modify eduroam 802-1x.phase1-auth-flags 32
```

And try to connect again.

If you still encounter Wi-Fi related issues, try reverting to the `wpa_supplicant` backend or reach out to support on https://discord.bazzite.gg.

## Error on connecting to Wi-Fi: "IP configuration was unavailable" when connecting to 802.1x wireless networks

!!! info "For performance reasons, and to fix certain issues in relation to streaming, [`iwd`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd) replaced [`wpa_supplicant`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wpa_supplicant) as the default WiFi backend for Bazzite since 2026. To switch back, run `ujust toggle-iwd`. Note that switching will **remove** all network configurations."

Check the system logs with `ujust logs-this-boot | grep NetworkManager`, you should be able to see that 

```
NetworkManager[1563]: <info>  [1770094603.8488] device (wlan0): state change: failed -> disconnected (reason 'none', managed-type: 'full')
NetworkManager[1563]: <info>  [1770094603.8568] dhcp4 (wlan0): canceled DHCP transaction
NetworkManager[1563]: <info>  [1770094603.8569] dhcp4 (wlan0): activation: beginning transaction (timeout in 45 seconds)
NetworkManager[1563]: <info>  [1770094603.8569] dhcp4 (wlan0): state changed no lease
```

When using the `iwd` backend, NetworkManager may be unable to obtain a DHCP lease on an Enterprise network if you have connected to it previously on a different backend or a different OS. 

If you prefer to keep using the `iwd` backend, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/iwd/
sudo nano /etc/iwd/main.conf
```

Then add the following:

```ini
[General]
AddressRandomization=network
```

Afterwards, press `Ctrl+X` and `Y` to Save & Exit, then reload `iwd` by running:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart iwd
```

You should be able to connect to the enterprise network.
If you still encounter Wi-Fi related issues, try reverting to the `wpa_supplicant` backend or reach out to support on https://discord.bazzite.gg.

## Nvidia Optimus GPU not detected on laptops

**Issue:** If you are running Bazzite on a laptop with an Nvidia Optimus GPU, you might notice that games are running poorly and seem to be running on the integrated GPU.

**Resolution:** You need to enable supergfxctl which will automatically switch to the discrete Nvidia GPU when launching your games. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
ujust enable-supergfxctl
```

## Waking from sleep doesn't work with a Gigabyte b550 motherboard

**Issue:** Once a Gigabyte b550 motherboard suspends, it does not properly resume, and the display remains black until a reboot.

**Resolution:** This can be fixed by disabling GPP0 and GPP8 wakeup. A hidden ujust command is provided to toggle this fix:
```bash
ujust _toggle-gigabyte-wake-fix
```
