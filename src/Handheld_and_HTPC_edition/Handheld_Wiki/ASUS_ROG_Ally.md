### General Notes

- Holding the Armoury Crate button (on the side) allows you to switch to Mouse Mode
- Enable the Steam Power Button Handler setting in Handheld Daemon

### Optional Tweaks

- Adjust settings in Handheld Daemon.
- Adjust the scaling of the UI in the Display Settings.

### Known Issues
- Changing A/C power sometimes leads to a stuck TDP.
  - This happens when removing the charger when in standby.
  - Attaching and removing the charger while not in standby is a workaround.
- Some users report the mic sounding garbled
  - Solution to that is to set the mic/input volume to 10%-15% in settings
  - For Discord you also need to set the input profile in the Discord Settings to voice cancellation.
- (Xbox Ally Only) Audio swaps from left to right internal speakers as mono.
  - This is a known problem that is supposed to be fixed on Kernel 6.19
- Some users report that "Auto UMA" in the bios can cause crashes in some games.
  - If you encounter this, then try setting the VRAM in bios to **4GB** or **8GB**.
- LED indicator is on max brightness by default and cannot be changed on any other operating system outside of Windows.
  - This is tied to the firmware.
  - This also affects when the ally is charging and sleeping.
- The Ally does **not support** button holding for the Steam or QAM buttons.
  - Steam Input's chords do not work by default.
    - Swapping the Start/Select button(s) is a workaround.
- Suspend can break if SMT is disabled
- Fingerprint driver does not work.
- Storage shows duplicate drives.
  - This is a visual bug, do **not** attempt to format this drive!
- Turning on the wake animation when resuming from sleep causes the device to act erratically.
  - No controls outside of Steam.
  - Steam's top and bottom panels missing.

#### CPU Boost?

Disabled by default to prevent excessive power draw to the device.
