## General Issues

- Devices using the Ryzen 7 6800U or any of its derivatives requires the fingerprint scanner to be disabled to have working suspend-resume.
- Devices using the Ryzen 7 7840U, or any of its derivatives (2023-2025) have partially working suspend-resume, where the device is forced into hibernation after a 5% battery drain. This issue is tracked [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3154).
- Back buttons may need to be manually remapped before they are usable.
  - Manually remap back buttons using the QAM, which is now handled by [OpenGamepadUI.](https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI)
- Games can sometimes default to 800p resolution.
  - Manually change the resolution per game in the **Steam Settings → Properties → Game Resolution** to either **Native** or other higher resolutions.
