### Known Issues

#### Bazzite 44 Known Issues

- No RGB Control.

#### Other Known Issues

- Suspending the device requires the latest BIOS update.
  - Reports of controller issues on wake have reported inconsistency. Enabling "full initial usb support" in Bios seems to have an impact on how frequent the issue is.
- VRAM size option is missing from BIOS as it's controlled by AYASPACE application under windows. 

> You can still change the amount of UMA buffer size using [Smokeless_UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF), but this method has its own associated risks. Only proceed **at your own risk**.

### e-GPU Support:

Using e-GPU via Thunderbolt 3, 4 and USB4 enclosures over USB4 are partially supported.

=== "AMD"

    - Automatic switch at boot with [all-ways-egpu](https://github.com/ewagner12/all-ways-egpu/tree/main) works fine using method 2 and 3 at boot, however method 1 is unfortunately not supported.
      - The script needs to be installed with [Steam Deck/User Installation](https://github.com/ewagner12/all-ways-egpu/blob/main/README.md#steamosbazziteuser-installation).
    - There are no known issues booting with eGPU attached(RDNA 2 GPUs are a known working configuration) and Bazzite will set the required kernel arguments by default (`amdgpu.ppfeaturemask`).
      - Using `rpm-ostree kargs --append-if-missing=pci=nommconf` (or editing the kernel command line with `rpm-ostree kargs --editor`) may still be needed according to user testing as some applications  may underperform otherwise.

=== "NVIDIA"
  
    Currently untested but _may_ work with the “-nvidia-deck” variant of bazzite.
