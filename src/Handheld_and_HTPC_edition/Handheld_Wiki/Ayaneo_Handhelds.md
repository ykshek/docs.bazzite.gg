### Workarounds / Known Issues

- Suspending the device requires the latest BIOS update.
  - Reports of controller issues on wake have reported inconsistency. Enabling "full initial usb support" in Bios seems to have an impact on how frequent the issue is.
- VRAM size option is missing from BIOS as it's controlled by AYASPACE application under windows. You can change the amount of UMA buffer size using [Smokeless_UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF), but this method has its own associated risks.

### Functional HHD

```
sudo systemctl enable --now hhd@$(whoami)
```

### e-GPU Support:

- e-GPU Thunderbolt 3/4 and USB4 enclosures over USB4 are supported.
  - **AMD**:
    - Automatic switch at boot with [all-ways-egpu](https://github.com/ewagner12/all-ways-egpu/tree/main) works fine using method 2 and 3 at boot, unfortunately method 1 is not supported.
      - The script needs to be installed with [Steam Deck/User Installation](https://github.com/ewagner12/all-ways-egpu/blob/main/README.md#steamosbazziteuser-installation).
    - No issue in booting with eGPU attached. Tested on RX 6800 and no kernel parameters are needed since Bazzite is now enabling the needed argument by default (amdgpu .ppfeaturemask).
      - Using `rpm-ostree kargs --append-if-missing=pci=nommconf` (or editing the kernel command line with `rpm-ostree kargs –editor`) is still needed according to my testing because some applications otherwise may underperform.
    - Some AMD cards requires to set a correct limit for GPU and Memory Clocks, this is a known issue that is present also on Desktops. I suggest installing LACT and setting the correct limits for the card.
  - **NVIDIA**: currently untested but _may_ work with the “-nvidia-deck” variant of bazzite.
