!!! info

    As of July 2025, external monitors works without issues. The external display can be set to its respective native resolution and refresh rate.

If your screen doesn't display the correct output or looks grainy, noisy, or oddly colorful then you will have to enter a [TTY session](/Handheld_and_HTPC_edition/quirks.md#tty-if-you-cannot-access-desktop-mode) or establish an ssh connection and enter this command:

```bash
mv ~/.config/kwinoutputconfig.json ~/.config/kwinoutputconfig.json.old
```
