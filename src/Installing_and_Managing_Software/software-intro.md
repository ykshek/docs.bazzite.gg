# Introduction to Installing Software on Bazzite

## Linux Package Formats
**Package formats ranked from most recommended to least recommended for daily usage**:

0. [**`ujust`**](./ujust.md) (_Convenience Commands_) - Custom scripts maintained by Bazzite & Universal Blue contributors that can also install a small subset of applications. 
<small>This takes precedent over other formats but since it can only install only a small set of software, it is considered the primary method of installing software in the same sense as installing applications from the Bazaar app store is.</small>
1. [**Bazaar App Store (Flatpak)**](./Flatpak.md) (_Graphical Applications_) - Universal package format using a permissions-based model and should be used for most graphical applications, **it is primary method of obtaining software on Bazzite**.
2. [**Homebrew**](./Homebrew.md) (_Command-Line Tools_) - Install applications intended to run inside of the terminal (CLI/TUI).
3. **Containers** -
    3a. [**Distrobox Containers**](./Distrobox.md) (_Linux Packages & Development Workflows_) - Access to most Linux package managers for software that do not support Flatpak and Homebrew and for use as development boxes.
    3b. [**Quadlet**](./Quadlet.md)  (_Services_) - Run containerized applications as a [systemd service](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/chap-managing_services_with_systemd#sect-Managing_Services_with_systemd-Services).
4. [**AppImage**](./AppImage.md) (_Portable Graphical Applications_) - Portable universal package format that relies on specific host libraries at a system-level, usually obtained from a project's website.
5. [**`rpm-ostree`**](./rpm-ostree.md) (_System-Level Packages_) - Layer Fedora packages at a system-level (**not recommended, use as a last resort**)

## Bazaar App Store (Flatpak) [Recommended for Most Apps]

![Bazaar|2840x2038, 30%](../img/Bazaar.jpg)

Flatpak is a universal containerized package format that tries to sandbox applications through flexible permissions that the application has access to on your system.  It is the **primary method of installing applications on Bazzite** and the most recommended way to install software over other formats outside of the few exceptions of software available in the Bazzite Portal which take priority. Flatpaks can be installed, upgraded, and uninstalled via the Bazaar app store.  The applications that are in Bazaar are from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/).

### Manage Flatpaks

Manage Flatpaks with [Flatseal](https://github.com/tchx84/Flatseal) and [Warehouse](https://github.com/flattool/warehouse) which are both pre-installed.

#### Flatseal

**Flatseal** is for changing [application permissions](https://github.com/tchx84/Flatseal/blob/92e675e5ad2129f2aabf324261570eef442494f6/DOCUMENTATION.md) if necessary. Alternatively, use KDE Plasma's system settings which has application permissions to adjust as well on KDE Plasma images.

Sometimes a project's website or [Github repository](<https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.Discord/wiki/Rich-Precense-(discord-rpc)#flatpak-applications>) contain information on what permissions need to be changed to perform certain functionality.

#### Warehouse

**Warehouse** is a utility that gives users a graphical interface to **downgrade applications**, install remote Flatpak sources outside of Flathub at your own risk, and backup application user data.

<hr>

## Homebrew (Command-Line Utilites)
    
!!! note

    Any package that requires root privileges will either need a rootful Distrobox container or has to be layered with `rpm-ostree`.

Homebrew is a package manager that installs packages into their own prefix. It is primarily used for command-line interface (CLI) and terminal user interface (TUI) applications. Homebrew can also install graphical applications using the `--cask` flag, but most are for macOS as support for casks on Linux is still developing. Use the Bold Brew application or the terminal using the command below to install packages.

Install packages in a host terminal with this **terminal command**:

```
brew install <package>
```

<hr>

## `ujust` Commands

`ujust` commands can install specialized software that ships with Bazzite as an installation script by the maintainers and contributors of the project.  Please note that _some_ of the software that can be installed from `ujust` commands can add **[layered packages]**(../rpm-ostree.md) to your installation which is generally not recommended.

**The Bazzite Portal application provides a graphical interface for installing some of the `ujust` commands**.

Read more about `ujust` commands on the [**`ujust` Bazzite documentation page**](../ujust.md) since `ujust` commands can accomplish more than install software.

<hr>

## Containers (Distrobox/Quadlet)

### Distrobox Containers (Linux Package Formats)

![distrobox|510x413](../img/distrobox.png)

Run other minimal variants of popular Linux distributions in Bazzite inside of a container and access each distribution's packages without any of their dependencies and libraries affecting the host machine.

- Containers are **not** virtual machines.
- Containers are intended to be **disposable** and may run into issues where they need to be recreated.
- Using this method to obtain software **requires knowledge of how traditional Linux operating systems install packages**.
  - Create a test container to familiarize yourself with basic Linux commands before diving in further.

Distrobox containers run sub-systems of other popular [Linux distributions](https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#containers-distros) with access to their package managers (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, etc.) and their package formats (`.deb`/`.rpm`) and any additional repositories like the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/). Distrobox containers can be used for both **development environments** and **installing applications that are not available in any of the other installation methods** which can be exclusive to specific package managers.

### Quadlet (Services)

Quadlet is a feature of [podman](https://podman.io/) that allows a user to run a container as [systemd](https://systemd.io/) units. It works by using a declarative syntax like [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) but integrates to systemd and uses podman as a backend.

#### Quadlet Usecases

Quadlet can be used for application packaged as a container such as a server application. You can find a lot of examples of containerized applications from [Linux Server](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/).

#### Managing Quadlet

Quadlet can be managed like any other systemd service using below command.

**Checking quadlet status**
```sh
systemctl --user status nginx
```

**Stopping quadlet**
```sh
systemctl --user stop nginx
```

You can see more commands in [man systemctl](https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemctl.1) or [tldr systemctl](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/pages/linux/systemctl).

!!! note

    Do not add the `.container` suffix when you interact with systemctl or an error will occur.

#### Quadlet File Locations

You can put your quadlet in these locations sorted by priority:

- `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/systemd/` - Usually used for temporary quadlet
- `~/.config/containers/systemd/` - Recommended location
- `/etc/containers/systemd/users/$(UID)`
- `/etc/containers/systemd/users/`

!!! note

    If you want your service to start even when you are not logged in, run `loginctl enable-linger $USER` to start it automatically.

#### Running Quadlet on Startup

You may want to run your quadlet automatically on startup, just add an install section to the quadlet file if you want it to autostart. Most of the time `default.target` is what you want but if you need other target you can read about that on systemd docs.

```
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

#### Converting Docker Compose to Quadlet Unit

You will find that most of containerized apps in the web are built using docker compose. Even the Linux Server that is linked above has all containers documented using a compose file. So you will need to convert it first, before running it as quadlet, fortunately you can use [podlet](https://github.com/containers/podlet) to help you converting it.

!!! note

    By default quadlet require full repository name. Most images are in docker hub so add `docker.io/` (e.g "nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged" becomes "docker.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged") to it.

#### Running Rootful Container as Quadlet

While ideally you would run all containers using rootless podman, unfortunately not all containers will work with it.  Use rootful podman by using a different quadlet path and run using root systemctl (without `--user`).

Rootful Quadlet Paths
- `/run/containers/systemd/` - Temporary quadlet
- `/etc/containers/systemd/` - Recommended location
- `/usr/share/containers/systemd/` - Image defined

### Common Quadlet Key Description

| Option        | Example                                     | Description                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ContainerName | ContainerName=nginx                         | Name of the container.                                                                   |
| Image         | Image=docker.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged | Container image that you want to use.                                                    |
| AutoUpdate    | AutoUpdate=registry                         | Source to check for update. The value is either `registry` or `local`.                   |
| PublishPort   | PublishPort=8080:8080                       | Port opened by container. (HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT)                                     |
| Volume        | Volume=/path/to/data:/data:z                | Link host folder with container folder. (HOST_FOLDER:CONTAINER_FOLDER:OPTION)            |
| Network       | Network=host                                | Network used by container. The value can be `host`, `none`, or user defined network name |

!!! note

    The `z` option in volume is to prevent selinux from blocking access to the folder. You can read more [here](https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman-run.1.html#volume-v-source-volume-host-dir-container-dir-options).

#### Troubleshooting

If your quadlet for some reason isn't found or starting, you can debug the container unit using `/usr/libexec/podman/quadlet -dryrun` for system quadlet or `/usr/libexec/podman/quadlet -user -dryrun` for user quadlet.

## AppImage (Portable Applications Downloaded from Trusted Source)

![AppImage|100x100, 100%](../img/AppImage.png)

AppImage is a universal package format that attempts to bundle every dependency that an application needs into one portable file. They can be installed by downloading any file with a `.AppImage` file extension and then giving it executable permissions in the file's properties so the application can run properly. Like Windows executable files, they are usually found on the project's website to download.

<hr>

## System-Level Package Layering (`rpm-ostree` Commands) [_**Not Recommended**_]

Install Linux packages on top of the existing Bazzite image.  Use as a last resort and specifically for packages that cannot be installed from Homebrew or ran inside of a container.  Layered packages can break system upgrades until removed due to dependency issues since the package will have to be updated with the rest of the image.  It also causes upgrades to take longer to run.
