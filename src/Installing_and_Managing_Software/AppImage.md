# AppImage

AppImage is a universal package format that attempts to bundle every dependency that an application needs into one portable file. They can be installed by downloading any file with a `.AppImage` file extension and then giving it executable permissions in the file's properties so the application can run properly. Like Windows executable files, they are usually found on the project's website to download. You should only download AppImages from sources that you trust.

Applications installed as an AppImage can integrate with your desktop and be managed with [Gear Lever](https://github.com/mijorus/gearlever) which you can install in [Bazaar](./Flatpak.md).  Gear Lever will also check for new updates, but **upgrades will still need to be applied manually**.
