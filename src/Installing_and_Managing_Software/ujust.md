# `ujust` Commands

## Usage

![Shell Scripts (.sh)|96x96, 100%](../img/Shell_Scripts__sh.png)

!!! note

    Use the [Bazzite Portal](./Bazzite_Portal.md) application as a graphical interface for popular `ujust` commands.

`ujust` commands that automate tasks using scripts which can be utilized to for system configuration and maintenance. 

It also can install specialized software that ships with Bazzite as an installation script by the maintainers and contributors of the project.

!!! info 
  
    Please note that _some_ of the software that can be installed from `ujust` commands can add [**layered packages**](../rpm-ostree.md) to your installation which is generally not recommended, but is rather a compromise between ease of use and update stability. 
    
    Bazzite maintainers try to keep them updated to avoid breakages, though the general advise is still to keep as little layered packages as possible and to reset ostree if you encounter any difficulties with updates.

### Common Script Naming Style

- `install-`: Install programs that is otherwise difficult or impossible to set up with other methods.

!!! warning "Some of the applications avaliable to install as a `ujust` command can end up [layering packages](./rpm-ostree.md) to your system. Bazzite recommends keeping layered packages to a minimum."

- `get-`: Install Decky plugins, though some other function also use this prefix.
- `setup-`: Install program, provides uninstall and configuration options for after install.
- `configure-`: Configure something that came by default on the image.
  - If it must be installed first, then it will be prefixed with `setup-`.
- `toggle-`: Enables or disables a feature or setting.
  - Selection might be automatic or manual depending on implementation.
- `fix-`: Fixes, patches or workarounds for an issue.
- `distrobox-`: Distrobox exclusive verb intended to make container usage easier.
- `foo`: Replace this with whatever the command is called.
  - These are shortcuts that we have deemed necessary to not have a verb.
    - **Examples**: `ujust update` & `ujust enroll-secureboot-key`.
