![Shell Scripts (.sh)|96x96, 100%](../img/Shell_Scripts__sh.png)

!!! note

    Use the Bazzite Portal application as a graphical interface for popular `ujust` commands.

`ujust` commands that automate tasks using scripts which can be utilized to for system configuration and maintenance. It also can install specialized software that ships with Bazzite as an installation script by the maintainers and contributors of the project.  Please note that _some_ of the software that can be installed from `ujust` commands can add **[layered packages]**(../rpm-ostree.md) to your installation which is generally not recommended.

![ujust command list|690x411](../img/ujust_command_list.png)
<sub>This will output a list of available commands.</sub>

Open a host terminal and **enter this command**:

```
ujust
```


![ujust TUI|690x403](../img/ujust_TUI.png)

```
ujust --choose
```

This will show a terminal user interface of `ujust` commands that you can choose to execute with arrow keys or mouse input.

!!! attention

    Commands that require values or flags do not function with this method.

### Manually entering commands

**Find the command you want to use and enter**:

```

```

You can search for specific commands by **entering**:

```
ujust | grep "<search keyword(s)>"
```

- `install-`: Install program, there is no configuration or uninstall commands at this time.
    - **Warning**: Some of the applications avaliable to install as a `ujust` command can end up [layering packages](./rpm-ostree.md) to your system.
- `get-`: Install an "extension" like Decky plugins, and if it is an extension then it can use `get-` too.
- `setup-`: Install program, provides uninstall and configuration options for after install.
- `configure-`: Configure something that came by default on the image.
  - If it must be installed first, then it will be in `setup-`.
- `toggle-`: Enables or disables a feature or setting.
  - Selection might be automatic or manual depending on implementation.
- `fix-`: Fixes, patches or works around an issue.
- `distrobox-`: Distrobox exclusive verb intended to make container usage easier.
- `foo`: Replace this with whatever the command is called.
  - These are shortcuts that we have deemed necessary to not have a verb.
