## Overview

The Bazzite Portal is a configuration tool that uses [`ujust`](./ujust.md) commands to enable features, install system updates, install specific packages, and troubleshoot system issues:

- Installs useful tools like [Decky](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader), [OpenRGB](https://github.com/calcprogrammer1/openrgb), and [Waydroid](https://github.com/waydroid/waydroid).
- Uses [`topgrade`](https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade) to install updates for multiple package managers, including Bazzite, Flatpak (Bazaar), firmware (`fwupdmgr`), and Brew.
- Installs Homebrew apps from the [Universal Blue tap](https://github.com/ublue-os/homebrew-tap), and adds web apps for various streaming services.
- Gathers system logs, rolls back system updates, resets Bazzite to its default configuration, or rebases your system to a different version.

## How the Bazzite Portal works

This section explains how the Bazzite Portal uses a configuration file to organise and run its [`ujust`](./ujust.md) commands.

The Bazzite Portal's configuration is stored in `/usr/share/yafti/yafti.yml`, where you can see the menu items and the commands they'll run.

For example, this entry shows the `ujust` commands used by the `iwd` setting:

```yaml
     - id: "toggle-iwd"
        title: "iwd"
        description: "Enable or disable iwd as the Wi-Fi backend instead of wpa_supplicant."
        default: false
        status_script: "ujust toggle-iwd status"
        options:
          - id: "enable"
            label: "Enable"
            script: "ujust toggle-iwd enable"
          - id: "disable"
            label: "Disable"
            script: "ujust toggle-iwd disable"

```

This configuration generates menu options in Bazzite Portal that let you enable or disable `iwd`:
